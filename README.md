# Salsify - Line Server Problem

This is my submission for the Line Server Problem. The exercise documentation can e find here: <https://salsify.github.io/line-server.html>

The project consists in the creation and endpoint to retrive the content in a given line of a file.

## Initial Setup

As asked, you can find the files in the the only thing you need to have installed in your pc is docker and docker-compose. After that running this two commands should be enough to have the app running

```./build.sh```

```./run.sh <file_name>```

## Challenge approach

#### Metrics

#### Performed tests

#### Results

## Questions

#### How does your system work

#### How will your system perform with a 1 GB file? a 10 GB file? a 100 GB file

#### What documentation, websites, papers, etc did you consult in doing this assignment

#### What third-party libraries or other tools does the system use? How did you choose each library or framework you used

#### How long did you spend on this exercise? If you had unlimited more time to spend on this, how would you spend it and how would you prioritize each item

#### If you were to critique your code, what would you have to say about it

## Final notes

Really enjoy doing this challenge! Hope you consider my solution appropriate. If there is any problem in the test process our there's any doubt I can clarify, just let me know.

Hope to be part of the team soon. Looking forward for the next meeting.
